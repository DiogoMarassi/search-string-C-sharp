1. INTRODUCTION
The rapid growth of the world’s population, combined with intense competition, exploitation of natural resources, climate
change, environmental challenges, and natural disasters, has posed severe risks to agricultural output and urbanization,
increasing demand for food and agricultural products. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the global
population will be 10 billion by 2050, with 7 billion people living in urban areas; therefore, 70% more food must be produced
to feed the population [1,2]. Integrating innovative technologies into agricultural practices to boost productivity and create
the necessary food supply has resulted in new concepts known as “smart agriculture” [1-3]. Smart agriculture, better known
as precision agriculture or Agriculture 5.0, is a concept that integrates cutting-edge smart technologies, mechatronics and
autonomous systems, protocols, data-driven solutions, and computational paradigms to improve agricultural processes,
increase the volume and quality of agricultural and food products, and optimize the utilization of resources, and enhance the
efficiency, sustainability, and productivity of farming practices [4-6]. It leverages several emerging technologies like smart
agricultural equipment, smart sensors, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud
computing, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), agricultural robotics, radio frequency identification (RFID), global
positioning systems (GPS), big data analytics, satellite imaging and remote sensing, Blockchain technology, AI, geographic
information system (GIS) and mapping technologies, additive manufacturing, and others to monitor, manage, and optimize
agricultural operations [7-9].</p>
      <p>Smart agriculture employs a variety of sensors, including ground-based, aerial, satellite-based, and IoT devices, which are
installed, worn, or implanted in various parts of the farm to collect agricultural data on livestock health, machinery, crop
condition, pH levels, humidity, temperature, nutrient levels, weather, growth stages, pest infestations, and soil condition. The
collected data is transmitted to remote analytics servers or the cloud via wireless communication technologies (e.g.,
Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long Range (LoRa) radio technology, NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT), SigFox, Wireless
Fidelity (Wi-Fi), and fifth generation (5G), or satellite communication) for storage and analysis. A predetermined model,
sophisticated analytics approaches, and decision rules are used to identify insights from the stored real-time and historical
data on farm conditions. Farmers utilize the information gained via the application layer to make informed decisions
regarding crop management, irrigation timing, spraying, pest and disease control, fertilization, and resource allocation
[1013]. The main objective of SA is to transform farms into connected and smart ecosystems by seamlessly integrating
cuttingedge technologies, data analytics, and AI to improve crop production and sustainability, minimize resource waste, reduce
environmental impact, improve overall profitability, increase efficiency and profitability, and assist farmers in making
datadriven decisions [5][14-16]. According to Naidoo and Munga [17], the worldwide SA market value is expected to increase
from US$16.2 billion in 2023 to US$25.4 billion by 2028. North America has the most extensive smart agricultural market,
followed by Europe, Japan, China, South Korea, India, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, and South Africa. There are many
applications and use cases of smart agricultural technology, such as monitoring climate conditions, environment and field
monitoring, crop health monitoring, precision agriculture, greenhouse automation, livestock and poultry monitoring and
management, and others [11][18-20]. Smart agriculture offers several benefits: better traceability and transparency,
datadriven decision-making, improved food safety and traceability, reduced operational costs, resource optimization and
efficiency, and many more [21-23].</p>
      <p>Despite the numerous potential benefits offered by SA, the new paradigm is susceptible to advanced persistent threats,
agroterrorism, autonomous system hijacking, backdoor attacks, blockchain attacks, brute-force attacks, endpoint attacks,
Cloud attacks, data breaches, denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, eavesdropping attacks, evasion
attacks, insider attacks, IoT breaches, malware injection attacks, man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, phishing attacks,
poisoning attacks, session hijacking, radio frequency jamming attacks, ransomware attacks, and others [17][22][24][25].
These cyber-attacks have severe consequences for farmers, agricultural enterprises, and organizational infrastructures,
including financial losses, identity theft, service disruption, reputational damage, crop yield, and quality reduction, supply
chain disruption, data breaches, and privacy concerns, environmental damage, food safety risks, and loss of trust and
confidence [25][26]. Several traditional security and data privacy measures are employed in AgriTech to counteract these
cyber-attacks. They include data encryption, access control, firewalls, multi-factor authentication, regular updates and patch
management, intrusion detection, data anonymization and aggregation, risk assessment, identity-based cryptography,
intrusion prevention systems, intrusion detection systems, regular security audits, and vulnerability assessments, digital
signatures, data loss prevention systems, incident response plan, and security training [22][27-29]. These traditional
cybersecurity techniques depend on preset rules and signatures to detect and prevent known cyber risks and attacks in SA,
thus making them static and unresponsive to new cyber-attacks [29]. As a result, integrating emerging technologies such as
AI and machine learning is essential for improving and reshaping the cybersecurity environment in SA [2].
In SA, AI implements techniques like machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement
learning in cybersecurity to analyze vast amounts of agricultural data collected from sensors, drones, robots, and other IoT
devices to detect anomalies, predict potential attacks in real-time, instantly respond to security breaches, and guarantee smart
and computerized cyber defense [24][30-32]. Islam et al. [33] reported that the worldwide market value of AI in cybersecurity
is expected to rise from US$8.8 billion in 2020 to US$38.2 billion by 2026 at a 23.3% compound annual growth rate within
the period. Some AI applications in cybersecurity include anomaly detection, behavioral analysis, botnet detection, endpoint
security, fraud detection, and many more [34-38]. By leveraging AI in cybersecurity, smart agricultural systems can automate
and advance threat prediction, offer better endpoint protection, ensure better vulnerability management, easy botnet
detection, early and faster detection of new cyber threats and risks, fast response, higher accuracy, lower cost, better threat
intelligence, improved decision-making, and reduced false positives [34][39].</p>
      <p>Several reviews on the use of AI in cybersecurity have been published in recent years. However, to our knowledge, no
comprehensive review describes AI techniques for improving cybersecurity in SA. Thus, this study aimed to survey AI
applications in cybersecurity for SA. The contributions of this study are:
•
•
•
•
•</p>
      <p>To provide a state-of-the-art review of SA’s evolution, architecture, emerging technologies, and applications.
To conduct an in-depth literature study on cyber threats and challenges facing SA.</p>
      <p>To investigate and synthesize AI approaches in cybersecurity for SA.</p>
      <p>To explain how AI may be used in SA to enhance cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>To examine the ethical implications of employing AI in cybersecurity for SA.
The paper is organized into the following sections: Section 2 discusses the materials and methods used in the review. Section
3 examines the state-of-the-art of SA (i.e., evolution, architecture, emerging technologies, and applications) and the cyber
threats and challenges in smart agriculture explored in Section 4. Section 5 describes cybersecurity in smart agriculture, and
Section 6 explains artificial intelligence in SA (i.e., artificial intelligence techniques, AI applications in SA cybersecurity,
case studies and examples of AI applications in SA cybersecurity, and ethical concerns of using AI in cybersecurity). Finally,
Section 4 concludes the study.
This study comprehensively surveys the use of AI in cybersecurity for SA. This method enables the comprehensive
collection, assessment, and synthesis of existing literature, resulting in an extensive understanding of current trends,
challenges, and advancements. The relevant literature used in the survey was gathered from Journal articles, conference
proceedings, book chapters, magazines, and websites using relevant keywords from different academic databases and digital
libraries like Nature, Wiley Online Library, MDPI, ScienceDirect, Frontiers, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, IGI Global,
Springer, Taylor &amp; Francis, and Google Scholar. The research considered the relevant literature published between January
2021 and July 2024 written in English and focused on scientific and technical research, particularly in AI, cybersecurity, and
SA. A set of keywords and phrases related to AI, cybersecurity, and SA was used to search academic databases and digital
libraries. The search terms included “Cybersecurity Challenges in SA” OR “AI” AND “Cybersecurity” AND “SA” OR
“Machine Learning” AND “Cybersecurity” AND “Precision Agriculture” OR “Deep Learning” AND “Cyber Threats” AND
“Agriculture Technology” OR “AI” AND “Cyber Attacks” AND “Smart Farming” OR “Application of AI in Cybersecurity”
AND “Advantages of using AI in Cybersecurity” OR “Ethical Concerns in Application of AI in Cybersecurity” AND their
intersections, were used to extract the relevant literature for the study. The Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” were
employed to filter the search results and ensure relevant material inclusion.</p>
      <p>The exclusion criteria included research papers that were not in English, not directly related to the research focus, and papers
with insufficient methodological details or lacking empirical evidence. The literature search biases were mitigated using a
test-retest approach, comprehensive search strategies, transparent reporting, peer review, critical appraisal, sensitivity
analyses, conflict of interest disclosure, meta-analysis, and ongoing monitoring. Relevant research data from the selected
studies were extracted using predefined key information such as (1) Title, authors, and publication year, (2) Objectives and
research questions, (3) AI techniques used, (4) Cybersecurity applications (e.g., threat detection, risk assessment), (5) SA
applications (e.g., precision farming, IoT integration), and (6) Results and conclusions. A total of 180 relevant research
papers were reviewed, of which 01 were from Nature, 03 from Wiley Online Library, 39 from MDPI, 10 from ScienceDirect,
02 from Frontiers, 63 from IEEE Xplore Digital Library, 02 from IGI Global, 05 from Springer, 02 from Taylor &amp; Francis,
and 53 from Google Scholar. These research papers were analyzed, evaluated, and classified according to their relevance to
the AI applications in cybersecurity for SA. Figure 1 depicts the distribution of digital libraries according to the year of
publication.</p>
      <p>The data extracted from the selected literature were synthesized and analyzed using qualitative synthesis and thematic
analysis. The analysis focused on AI technique categorization, identification of common cybersecurity threats, and assessing
the effectiveness of AI solutions in addressing these threats in SA contexts. The findings presented in the survey were
confirmed by consulting with subject experts, cross-referencing findings with previous literature studies, and critically
analyzing the strength of the conclusions reached. Each research paper was evaluated for quality based on the methodology’s</p>
